In recent years, the role of the immune system in the devel-opment of hypertension has received increased attention. Renal immune cell inﬁltration has been demonstrated in both experimental and clinical hypertension, with lymphocytes and macrophages localizing to regions of injury.1–5 Importantly, experimental studies using an adoptive transfer approach in immunodeﬁcient mice demonstrated the importance of T lym-phocytes in the development of experimental hypertension.6Work in our laboratory indicates that T cells play a pivotal role in the ampliﬁcation of salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats.2 In SS rats, as in the clinical condition, hypertension is a genetically determined progressive disease, which culminates in renal injury, albuminuria, increased oxida-tive stress, and reduced glomerular ﬁltration rate.7–10 Deﬁning the mechanisms involved in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in the SS rats is, therefore, of clinical interest. Increased renal T-cell inﬁltration has been demonstrated in SS rats maintained on 4.0% NaCl high-salt (HS) diet for 3 weeks compared with those maintained on a 0.4% NaCl control salt diet.11,12 We have also demonstrated that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of immune cell function reduces the inﬁl-tration of immune cells into the kidneys of SS rats, which is associated with the attenuation of both salt-sensitive hyperten-sion and renal injury.11–15 Interestingly, selective mutation of a component of the T-cell receptor complex (CD247) attenuated salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage in SS rats.13 In this model, the protective effects of T-cell mutation became apparent during the later stages of disease progression, with blood pressure being signiﬁcantly lower than that of the SS rats from days 14 to 21 of a HS diet.13 From these data, we hypothesize that inﬁltrating immune cells serve to amplify the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in the SS rat.Despite strong evidence supporting the involvement of T cells in both clinical and experimental hypertension, the sig-nals involved in the initiation of renal inﬁltration remain elu-sive. Previous servo-control studies from our laboratory, in which pressure to the left kidney of SS rats was maintained at the control level, whereas the right kidney was exposed to salt-induced hypertension, have demonstrated an association between increased blood pressure, renal macrophage inﬁltra-tion, and renal injury.16 ED-1 staining to quantify macrophages in the glomerular tuft demonstrated increased inﬁltration in the uncontrolled hypertensive kidneys compared with the servo-controlled kidneys.16 On the basis of these data, we hypothesized Abstract—Renal T-cell inﬁltration is a key component of salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Here, we use an electronic servo-control technique to determine the contribution of renal perfusion pressure to T-cell inﬁltration in the SS rat kidney. An aortic balloon occluder placed around the aorta between the renal arteries was used to maintain perfusion pressure to the left kidney at control levels, ≈128 mm Hg, during 7 days of salt-induced hypertension, whereas the right kidney was exposed to increased renal perfusion pressure that averaged 157±4 mm Hg by day 7 of high-salt diet. The number of inﬁltrating T cells was compared between the 2 kidneys. Renal T-cell inﬁltration was signiﬁcantly blunted in the left servo-controlled kidney compared with the right uncontrolled kidney. The number of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ T cells were all signiﬁcantly lower in the left servo-controlled kidney. This effect was not speciﬁc to T cells because CD45R+ (B cells) and CD11b/c+ (monocytes and macrophages) cell inﬁltrations were all exacerbated in the hypertensive kidneys. Increased renal perfusion pressure was also associated with augmented renal injury, with increased protein casts and glomerular damage in the hypertensive kidney. Levels of norepinephrine were comparable between the 2 kidneys, suggestive of equivalent sympathetic innervation. Renal inﬁltration of T cells was not reversed by the return of renal perfusion pressure to control levels after 7 days of salt-sensitive hypertension. We conclude that increased pressure contributes to the initiation of renal T-cell inﬁltration during the progression of salt-sensitive hypertension in SS rats.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:543-551.

544  Hypertension  September 2017that exposure to elevated blood pressure is a prerequisite for renal T-cell inﬁltration in salt-sensitive hypertension in SS rats.In the current study, chronic servo-control experiments were used to determine the role of increased blood pressure in renal T-cell inﬁltration in SS rats. A custom-designed and built computer-driven servo-control system, which we have previ-ously described,17 was used to maintain pressure to the left kid-ney at control levels during 7 days administration of a 4.0% NaCl diet, whereas the right kidney was exposed to a progres-sive increase in pressure. In a subsequent study, we used the servo-control system to return pressure to the left kidney back to control levels after 7 days of salt-sensitive hypertension. The results of these studies provide strong evidence that augmented T-cell inﬁltration occurs in response to a rise of arterial pres-sure in the early phase of hypertension in the SS rat.MethodsExperimental AnimalsMale SS/JrHsdMcwi (SS) rats were obtained at weaning from a col-ony developed and maintained at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Breeders and offspring at weaning were fed a puriﬁed AIN-76A rodent food diet (Dyets, Bethleham, PA) containing 0.4% NaCl with ad libitum water. The HS diet contained 4.0% NaCl. All experimen-tal protocols were approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Surgical PreparationBefore surgery, all rats were trained to a bidirectional turntable cage system (Rodent Workstation with Raturn system; Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) for a minimum of 7 days. Rats were sur-gically prepared, under isoﬂurane anesthetic, at 9 to 12 weeks as we have previously described.18 In brief, an inﬂatable silastic occluder attached to Tygon tubing was placed around the aorta, between the renal arteries. The Tygon tubing was tunneled subcutaneously and exited at the nape of the neck. The occluder was connected to a cus-tom-made infusion pump with a stepper motor (MDrive23; Intelligent Motion systems, Marlborough, CT). Catheters were implanted in the femoral vein for the administration of analgesics and anesthetic and in the carotid and femoral arteries for the measurement of mean arterial pressure above and below the occluder. All catheters were tunneled subcutaneously and exited at the nape of the neck. Sham rats were prepared identically; however, the occluder cuff was not inﬂated. All rats had 7 days recovery after surgery, before the initia-tion of blood pressure measurements.Servo-Control ProtocolThroughout the study, saline was continuously infused into the venous catheter at 6.9 μL/min, and mean arterial pressure was recorded 24 hours/d from both carotid and femoral catheters. Baseline measure-ments were made during 3 days to obtain stable control measure-ments while the rats were maintained on 0.4% NaCl control diet. Subsequently, the salt content of the diet was increased to 4.0%, and measurements continued for a further 7 days. During the consumption of a 4.0% NaCl HS diet, renal perfusion pressure (RPP) to the left kidney was continuously maintained moment to moment within ±5 mm Hg of the average control value. A sham group of rats underwent an identical surgical and experimental protocol; however, the vascular occluder cuff was not inﬂated during the study, and both kidneys were exposed to salt-induced hypertension. In the reversal study, baseline measurements were made during 3 days while the rats were fed 0.4% NaCl. The rats were then switched to 4.0% NaCl for 7 days. During this period, the aortic occluder was not inﬂated, and both kidneys were exposed to salt-sensitive hypertension. After 7 days of 4.0% NaCl, the occluder was inﬂated to bring the RPP to the left kidney back to the control level, where it was maintained for a further 7 days.Tissue CollectionServo-control of RPP to the left kidney was continued throughout the tissue collection to prevent exposure of the left kidney to an uncon-trolled pressure. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg IV), and both kidneys were ﬂushed with saline. The upper pole of each kidney was removed for T-cell isolation. A thin slice, 2 mm around the papilla, was cut and ﬁxed in 10% formaldehyde solution for histological analysis. The bottom pole was snap frozen, and RNA isolated for quantitative polymerase chain reaction.T-Cell IsolationTo isolate mononuclear cells, we used our previously described pro-tocol14 with some modiﬁcations. Kidneys were minced with razor blade, pressed through a 100-µm cell strainer (Falcon by Corning) and digested in 10 mL of RPMI-1640 (Gibco by Life Technologies) containing 0.1% of collagenase type IV (Worthington) and 10 µg/mL (or 230 U) of DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 25 minutes. After incubation, the kidney homogenate was diluted with Dulbecco’s phos-phate-buffered saline (DPBS; Gibco by Life Technologies), contain-ing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals) and 2 mmol/L EDTA (Invitrogen by Life Technologies; wash buffer), ﬁltered through a 70-µm strainer and centrifuged at 4°C at 300g for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of wash buffer, and after ﬁltering through a 40 µm cell strainer, centrifuged at 4°C at 350g for 7 minutes. To isolate the mononuclear cells, the obtained pellet was either resus-pended in 3 mL of FBS containing 10 mmol/L EDTA, layered over Histopaque-1083 (Sigma-Aldrich), or resuspended in 30% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich, DPBS 1X as diluent) and layered over 70% Percoll and centrifuged at 20°C at 400g for 30 minutes. The isolated mono-nuclear cells were collected, washed twice with wash buffer at 4°C at 400g for 5 minutes, and counted on hemocytometer. For ﬂow cyto-metric analysis, cells were resuspended in 100 µL of DPBS containing 0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich; stain buffer), stained with the following monoclonal ﬂuorochrome-labeled antibodies: anti-rat CD45–PE-Cy7 (BioLegend; Clone OX-1), anti-rat CD3–PerCP-eFluor 710 (eBiosci-ence; Clone G4.18), anti-rat CD8a–FITC (BioLegend; Clone OX-8), anti-rat CD4–APC-Cy7 (BioLegend; Clone W3/25), anti-rat CD45R–PE (BD Bioscience; Clone HIS24), and anti-rat CD11b/c–eFluor 660 (eBioscience; Clone OX-42) and analyzed on a LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Bioscience) with FACSDiva software. Data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva and FlowJo software. The isolation of cells from the kidney, the cell counting step, and the ﬂow cytometric analysis were performed in a blinded manner. The gating strategy is shown in Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement.Histological AnalysisThe formalin-ﬁxed tissue was parafﬁn embedded, cut into 4-μm sections, mounted, and stained with Gomori one-step trichrome. Tubular protein casts and glomeruli injury were quantiﬁed as previ-ously described.11 Glomeruli were scored by a blinded observer on a scale from 0 to 4. Two distinct populations were scored, cortical and juxtamedullary glomeruli, determined by their depth in the kidney. Separate sections were stained with CD3+ (anti-human CD3; 1:100; DAKO) for qualitative assessment of T-cell localization.Norepinephrine AssayIn 5 sham rats, the lower pole of each kidney was isolated and snap frozen for the analysis of tissue norepinephrine levels by high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography to determine whether surgical place-ment or the chronic presence of the aortic occluder produced injury of renal nerves and denervation of the kidneys.Statistical AnalysisData are presented as mean values±SEM. For mean arterial pressure data, within-group differences were assessed using a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a Holm–Sidak test for multiple com-parisons versus the average control pressure and the RPP to the left kidney. Renal norepinephrine levels and kidney weight were com-pared using a 2-tailed paired t test. For comparison of inﬁltrating Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on August 8, 2019

During 7 days of 4.0% NaCl con-sumption, RPP to the right uncontrolled kidneys increased progressively in the servo-controlled rats, from 133±2 mm Hg during the 0.4% NaCl control period to 157±4 mm Hg at HS day 7. RPP to the right kidneys was signiﬁcantly higher than the average control value from HS day 1 onward (P<0.001). In contrast, pressure to the left servo-controlled kidneys was maintained at control levels throughout the study, with HS day-7 values, 127±1 mm Hg, being equivalent to those recorded during the 0.4% NaCl period, 129±2 mm Hg (Figure 1A). Compression of the aorta by the inﬂatable occluder was reﬂected in the femoral arterial pulse pressure, which reduced from 36±1 mm Hg during the control period to 23±1 mm Hg during the HS period (P<0.001).In sham rats, RPP to both kidneys increased throughout the 4.0% HS challenge. RPP was signiﬁcantly higher than control values from HS-1 onward in the left kidneys and HS-2 in the right kidneys (Figure 1B). Notably, at HS day 7, RPP to the right kidneys of sham rats (154±2 mm Hg) was com-parable to that of the right hypertensive kidneys of the servo-controlled rats (157±4 mm Hg).Increased Renal Perfusion Pressure Augments Immune Cell Inﬁltration Into the KidneyFigure 1C shows lymphocyte inﬁltration into the left and right kidneys of servo-controlled rats. Lymphocyte inﬁl-tration was signiﬁcantly higher in the uncontrolled hyper-tensive right kidneys than in the servo-controlled left kidneys. Levels of all T cells (CD3+), and subsets of helper (CD3+CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD3+CD8+) T cells, were all sig-niﬁcantly higher in the uncontrolled hypertensive right kid-neys than in the pressure-controlled left kidneys (P<0.001). CD45R+ B-cell inﬁltration was also signiﬁcantly higher in the hypertensive kidney than in the servo-controlled kidney. Notably, the absolute number of B cells in the hypertensive kidneys was 4× lower than the absolute number of CD3+ T cells (Table).In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant difference in T-cell inﬁltration in the left and right kidneys of sham rats, which were exposed to comparable RPPs throughout the salt Figure 1.

546  Hypertension  September 2017challenge (Figure 1D). The abundance of CD3+ T cells per kidney in the left and right kidneys of sham rats were com-parable to the number of CD3+ T cells in the hypertensive right kidneys of the servo-controlled rats (Table). The same was true for the abundances of CD3+CD4+ (Figure 1D) and CD3+CD8+ (Figure 1D) T cells per kidney, which were also not signiﬁcantly different between the left and right kidneys of sham rats. Again, the absolute abundance of B cells in the hypertensive kidneys was 4× lower than that of CD3+ T cells.The protective effect of preventing hypertension was not speciﬁc to renal lymphocyte inﬁltration because there were signiﬁcantly fewer CD11b/c+ (monocytes and macrophages) cells in the servo-controlled left kidneys relative to the hyper-tensive right kidneys of the servo-controlled rats (Table). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the number of CD11b/c+ cells in the left and right kidneys of the sham rats (P=0.378; Table).Renal Norepinephrine Levels Are Equivalent in the Left and Right Kidneys of Surgically Prepared RatsPrevious studies have implicated sympathetic activity in the initiation of renal T-cell inﬁltration and the development of hypertension.19 To eliminate the possibility that the chronic servo-control protocol inadvertently caused renal denerva-tion, we measured norepinephrine levels in the left and right kidneys of 5 sham rats. In 3 of the rats, we also measured immune cell inﬁltration. Norepinephrine levels were not sig-niﬁcantly different between the left (93.2±18.3 pg/mg) and right kidneys (128.7±33.1 pg/mg; P=0.410), suggesting that neither the surgical preparation nor occluder damaged renal innervation.Increased Renal Perfusion Pressure Is Associated With Increased Renal Injury in SS RatsRenal histological analysis is illustrated in Figure 2. Trichrome staining was used for the quantiﬁcation of tubu-lar protein casts and glomerular injury in the cortex and medulla of left and right kidneys isolated from 6 servo-controlled and 6 sham rats. There were signiﬁcantly more tubular protein casts in both the cortex and medulla of the hypertensive right kidneys of servo-controlled rats compared with the pressure-controlled left kidneys (Figure 2A through 2D). Similarly, cortical glomerular injury was signiﬁcantly higher in the right hypertensive kidneys compared with the pressure-controlled left kidneys (Figure 2E; Figure S2). In contrast, there was no difference in the degree of glomeru-lar scarring injury observed in the juxtamedullary border region (Figure 2F). We found no difference in the degree of renal injury observed in the left and right kidneys of sham rats, both of which were exposed to uncontrolled pressures throughout the study (Figure 2A, 2B, 2E, and 2F). Given the involvement of T cells in renal ﬁbrogenesis,20,21 we assessed mRNA abundance of collagen and smooth muscle actin in the servo-control kidneys (Figure 3A and 3B). As shown in (Figure 3B), renal ﬁbrosis markers were all signiﬁcantly higher in the medulla of the hypertensive right kidneys relative to the servo-controlled left medullas. In contrast, although there was a trend toward increased ﬁbrosis mark-ers in the cortex, this only reached signiﬁcance for Col1a1 (Figure 3A). Flow cytometry does not give spatial localiza-tion of T-cell inﬁltration; therefore, histological slices were stained with CD3+ antibodies. Through qualitative exami-nation, we see dispersed inﬁltration throughout the kidney. Figure 3C and 3D show regions of high T-cell accumula-tion in the cortex and medulla, respectively, indicating that increased T-cell inﬁltration is not due exclusively to accumu-lation in one compartment of the kidney.The hypertensive kidneys of the servo-controlled rats were marginally heavier than the controlled left kidneys (2.1±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1 g, respectively; P<0.05). However, because the weights were comparable to the kidneys of the sham rats, both of which weighed 2.0±0.1 g, we would not expect this to account for the difference in immune cell inﬁltration.Seven-Day Reversal of Hypertension Does Not Return Renal T-Cell Inﬁltration to Control Levels in SS RatsTo assess the reversibility of renal immune cell inﬁltration, we used the chronic servo-control system to bring RPP to the left kidney back to control levels after 7-day exposure to salt-sensitive hypertension. After 7 days of HS, RPP to the left kidney averaged 136±2.1 mm Hg. At this point, the servo-control system was used to bring the pressure back to a level comparable to the average control level of 122±1.2 mm Hg (Figure 4A). Notably, during this reversal period, the rats continued to eat a 4.0% NaCl HS diet. There was a tendency Table.

Furthermore, although there was a trend for reduced T-cell inﬁltration in the left reversal kidney, we found no signiﬁcant difference from the right hypertensive kidneys of the reversal rats (Figure 4B). Together, these data indicate that 7 days of reversal of pressure alone is not sufﬁcient to either stop or reverse renal T-cell inﬁltration. In contrast, we found no sig-niﬁcant differences in the number of CD45R+ B cells in the left kidneys of sham and reversal rats (Table), and there were signiﬁcantly fewer B cells in the left reversal kidney than in the right hypertensive kidney of reversal rat (Figure 4B). This suggests that reversal of pressure did stop further signiﬁcant increases in B-cell inﬁltration.Histological analysis found that reversal of pressure did not reduce the formation of tubular protein casts. (Medullary protein casts: right hypertensive kidneys 1.7±0.6% versus left reversal kidneys 2.0±0.6% positive area; P=0.6, and cortical protein casts: right hypertensive kidneys 0.3±0.2% versus left reversal kidneys 0.8±0.4% positive area; P=0.2; n=6).

548  Hypertension  September 2017hypertensive kidneys 2.7±1.0 versus left reversal kidneys 2.2±0.8; P=0.6)DiscussionIncreased renal T-cell inﬁltration is a cardinal feature of salt-induced hypertension in the SS rat. Attenuation of renal T-cell inﬁltration blunts the hypertensive response to 21-day HS diet and improves renal structure.11–14 The present study used the unique servo-control protocol to address the role of elevated RPP in the initiation of renal T-cell inﬁltration in SS rats. The aim of these studies was to determine whether immune cell inﬁltration is a primary cause or secondary con-sequence of the hypertensive response to a HS diet in SS rats.Of note, a recent study used a combination of antihy-pertensive agents to discern the role of pressure in renal immune cell inﬁltration in angiotensin II (AngII)-dependent hypertension in mice.22 This study suggested that the attenu-ation of hypertension prevented T-cell inﬁltration into the kidneys of AngII-infused mice, indicating that increased pressure was involved in the initiation of renal inﬂamma-tion of that model. However, use of antihypertensive agents to control RPP can result in off-target and secondary drug effects, which could in themselves alter T-cell inﬁltration and activation and confound the interpretation of these results. Here, to address this question in SS rats, we used our unique servo-control system that allows us to more deﬁnitively study the effects of increased RPP in isolation. Importantly, this technique provides paired analysis of the kidneys within the same animal exposed to different perfu-sion pressures but with both kidneys exposed to the same hormonal milieus and the secondary effects of a high-salt intake throughout the study. Norepinephrine levels were comparable in the left and right kidneys suggestive of equal sympathetic drive. Therefore, in these studies, any observed changes in immune cell inﬁltration are a direct consequence of differences in RPP. The data presented show that renal immune cell inﬁltration occurs in response to elevated RPP in SS rats. After 7-day HS diet, there was a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of T cells, B cells, and monocytes and macrophages in the hypertensive uncontrolled right kidney compared with the servo-controlled left kidney of the servo-control rats. In previous servo-control studies, in which SS rats were maintained on a HS diet for 14 days, it was found that there was increased ED-1–positive macrophage accu-mulation around glomerular tufts in the hypertensive kidney relative to the servo-controlled kidney, in agreement with the ﬁndings of our current study. Interestingly, in this ear-lier study, the results from the servo-controlled kidney were compared with those of a sham rat maintained on a control salt diet. This allowed the effects of salt, independent of pressure, to be discerned. It was found that ED-1 staining, Figure 3.

Evans et al    Pressure Drives Renal T-Cell Inﬁltration    549glomerular injury, and tubular protein casts were equiva-lent in the servo-controlled kidney and a control salt sham kidney. These data suggest that increased salt intake, in the absence of increased pressure, is not sufﬁcient to induce macrophage inﬁltration and renal injury. Therefore, we postulate that in the current study the T-cell accumulation observed in the servo-controlled kidney would be compa-rable to that of a sham rat maintained on a control salt.The signaling pathway by which increased RPP drives renal immune cell inﬁltration has not been determined and is beyond the scope of this study. However, in our previ-ous servo-control study in SS rats, microarray analysis was used to determine which genes are differently expressed in the hypertensive kidney. After 14-day HS diet, several genes implicated in inﬂammation were signiﬁcantly higher in the hypertensive kidney than in the servo-controlled kid-ney. These included tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1, mac-rophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine–speciﬁc lectin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and complement component 4. Whether these genes are involved in the initiation of renal inﬂammation in salt-sensitive hypertension is an interesting area of future research. Increased immune cell inﬁltration was associated with increased renal injury, characterized by tubular protein casts, increased abundance of genes involved in renal ﬁbrosis, and glomerular damage, in the hypertensive kidneys of servo-controlled rats. We saw dis-persed T-cell inﬁltration using CD3+ immunohistochemis-try; however, unlike ﬂow cytometry, which gives a holistic view of the entire tissue, histological assessment represents only one slice and, therefore, provides insufﬁcient data to quantify inﬁltration.We interpret the present data to indicate that a primary defect in the SS rat leads to an initial increase in blood pres-sure with high-salt feeding and that increased blood pressure, by a mechanism not yet described, mediates the inﬁltration of immune cells into the kidney. As we have previously demon-strated, the inﬁltrating immune cells then serve to amplify the salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage.13,14Despite the clear role of RPP in the initiation of renal T-cell inﬁltration, 7-day reversal of pressure alone did not blunt this aspect of the inﬂammatory response. Although there was a trend toward reduced T cells in the reversal left kidney relative to the hypertensive right kidney, this did not reach signiﬁcance. It is possible that a longer reversal period is required to return renal T-cell inﬁltration to control lev-els. However, it is not technically feasible to extend this time course much beyond a period of 7 days. Because these studies selectively reverse RPP (the rats are maintained on 4.0% NaCl throughout), this may suggest a role for increased dietary salt in the ampliﬁcation and maintenance of renal T-cell abundance, after the initiation of inﬁltration.

550  Hypertension  September 2017with this observation, several recent studies have implicated salt in the activation of immune cells and the promotion of proinﬂammatory responses.21,23–26 Interestingly, in this study, the 7-day HS pressure in the SS rats was substantially lower than that observed in our ﬁrst experiment. This reﬂects the interexperimental variability of the SS rat. Nevertheless, we still observed a substantial inﬁltration of renal immune cells. We interpret these data to suggest that, either there is a pres-sure threshold, which once surpassed, initiates renal inﬂam-mation, or it is the magnitude of change in pressure, rather than the absolute pressure, that is important for the initiation of renal inﬂammation. Despite the blunted pressor response to HS in the SS rats used in the reversal experiments, the absolute number of inﬁltrating immune cells in the kidney at the end of the experiment was substantially higher. This may reﬂect a 2-hit inﬂammatory response, whereby increased pressure initiates the inﬁltration of immune cells and a HS diet perpetuates the response. However, given the variability of ﬂow cytometric data, further experiments would be needed to test this hypothesis.Although we have shown that renal T-cell inﬁltration is augmented by hypertension, the data presented do not pre-clude a role for T cells in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in SS rats; rather, they implicate the immune system in the secondary stages of the disease.PerspectivesRenal inﬁltration of immune cells has been described in both clinical and experimental hypertension. In this study, we have used a chronic servo-control technique to identify the role of RPP in renal immune cell inﬁltration in SS rats. We found that renal immune cell inﬁltration was signiﬁcantly higher in the hypertensive right kidney than in the servo-controlled left kidney. We interpret these data to indicate that inﬁltration of immune cells into the kidney occurs in response to an initial increase in pressure. As we have previously shown,13,14 the immune cells then amplify the salt-sensitive hypertension and renal injury
